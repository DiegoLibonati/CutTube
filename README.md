# CutTube

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository with `git clone "repository link"`
2. Join to `cuttube-app` folder and execute: `npm install` or `yarn install` in the terminal
3. Go to the previous folder and execute: `docker-compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml build --no-cache` in the terminal
4. Once built, you must execute the command: `docker-compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml up --force-recreate` in the terminal

NOTE: You have to be standing in the folder containing the: `dev.docker-compose.yml` and you need to install `Docker Desktop` if you are in Windows.

### Pre-Commit for Development (Python)

NOTE: Install **pre-commit** inside: `cuttube-api` folder.

1. Once you're inside the virtual environment, let's install the hooks specified in the pre-commit. Execute: `pre-commit install`
2. Now every time you try to commit, the pre-commit lint will run. If you want to do it manually, you can run the command: `pre-commit run --all-files`
